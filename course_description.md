Introduction to GUI development with Python 3 and TkInter.

In this course, we will explore the world of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using the Python 3 programming language. 

Along the way, we will talk about GUI fundamentals and how to use the GUI components (widgets) provided by Tkinter library for Python.

We will start very simply, explaining each component, and in the end we will put together everything and build our own GUI application which will be a Calculator.

Basic knowledge of Python is required.
